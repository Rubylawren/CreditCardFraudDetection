# CreditCardFraudDetection
Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project! This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed to identify fraudulent transactions using credit card data. The goal of this project is to showcase the application of data science and machine learning techniques in enhancing security measures for financial transactions.

#Project Overview

This project uses a dataset of credit card transactions that are labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately detect suspicious transactions. By using various machine learning algorithms, their performances are evaluated and the best model is optimized to achieve high accuracy and f1 score.

#Technologies Used

• Python 3: Primary programming language used.
• Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
• NumPy: For numerical operations.
• Scikit-Learn: For machine learning model development.
• Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
• Jupyter Notebook: For interactive code development and testing.

#Dataset

The dataset used in this project is gotten from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud , specifically the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. It includes features like user behaviors and dummy variables encoded for anonymity, alongside labels indicating fraudulent or normal transactions


#Usage

This project can be used by data scientists and analysts to understand and explore effective techniques in fraud detection within financial transactions. The notebooks contain detailed explanations and visualizations that explain the step-by-step approach and methodology.

#Contributing

Any recommendations on how to improve this model will be greatly appreciated.
